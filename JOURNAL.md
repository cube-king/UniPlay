Starting 6/27/2025, I've decided to start a journal in accordance with this project to document any problems I find while testing. 

Today, I came across an error where my OAuth popup seems to fail silently on the main server, but throws an error at localhost testing. I first tried to add error catching functionality to the program, and changed the origins to allow the main page - which allowed the popup to manifest (? bad wording here). However, I now got the following error: "You can't sign in to this app because it doesn't comply with Google's OAuth 2.0 policy."

This error appears to be related to some kind of redirect url misconfiguration, so I added my player as the authorization redirect. Now, I get errors about my security - the website appears to violate 'the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: data:"'. I've not worked with CSP before, as most of my websites have been completely self-contained and/or self referencing with no APIs used. So, after a bit of research, I discovered that I'd have to make my CSP more lenient in order to allow requests and communication with servers to come through. I'll test a CSP that allows basically everything in as long as it's from the correct google URLs. This seemed to work OK, but it still returned a "'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: data:" as required so I'll add that now.
