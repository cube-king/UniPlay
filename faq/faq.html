            <div class="question">
                <h1 id="qtitle" class="space-mono-bold">▶ Why won't my YouTube Videos load?</h1>
                <p id="qanswer">It's possible that your youtube videos are prevented from embedding on websites due to the creator's restrictions. 
                Many media groups put restrictions on when and where their videos can be embedded, so if your music doesn't work it may be 
                preferable to view the content purely on YouTube.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h1 id="qtitle" class="space-mono-bold">▶ Why is premium required for the Spotify functionality?</h1>
                <p id="qanswer">UniPlay uses an API based on Spotify's Device protocol, allowing a website or device to act as a virtual player for 
                Spotify. This, under Spotify's ruling, is only availible to Spotify Premium subscribers.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h1 id="qtitle" class="space-mono-bold">▶ Why is SoundCloud functionality currently limited?</h1>
                <p id="qanswer">SoundCloud has restricted its API to previous users only - 
                getting a new API key is a long and tedious process involving a lot of waiting, or a lot of overpay!</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h1 id="qtitle" class="space-mono-bold">▶ Where can I find the source code to this project?</h1>
                <p id="qanswer">The source code to UniPlay is availible at <a href="https://github.com/cube-king/UniPlay">https://github.com/cube-king/UniPlay</a></p>

            <div class="question">  
                <h1 id="qtitle" class="space-mono-bold">▶ What's the inspiration behind this website?</h1>
                <p id="qanswer">This website was created out of necessity. I found that having various songs and playlists across various streaming services was 
                tedious, so I thought - what if there was a method to unify every streaming service? Given the rich tools gifted by APIs - as well as a bit of ingenuity
                - it would be trivial to create such a thing. Due to the opportunity to build and create programs (courtesy of Hack Club), I was able to put significant time 
                and effort into solving this problem!</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h1 id="qtitle" class="space-mono-bold">▶ Do you sell data or collect cookies?</h1>
                <p id="qanswer">No! As of 6/21/2025 (and until otherwise stated), this program is 100% open source, free, and privacy-compatible! No data is sold, and only 
                necessary data is collected!</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h1 id="qtitle" class="space-mono-bold">▶ Will other services and music players be added?</h1>
                <p id="qanswer">Possibly - it depends on the support given for this project as well as the availability of the APIs for these programs respectively.</p>
