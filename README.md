# UniPlay - a unification of your music streaming software!

UniPlay, simply put, is a hub that unifies your music streaming services. Management of songs throughout platforms such as Soundcloud, Youtube and even Spotify! It allows for playlist merging, playing of individual songs, and even (perhaps in the future?) a unified search option!

## Plans

- Create a landing page and style it decently
- Create the main functional app, adding playlist request, merging, and functionality to
  - Youtube
  - Spotify
  - Soundcloud (? API keys are hard to get)
- Work on misc. features (e.g. shuffling, song discovery, searches, etc)
- Finish and touch up appearances

---

Some features may not be availible in time simply due to difficulty - the YouTube API is severely impacted by embed restrictions from major publishers such as UMG. As well, the SoundCloud API keys are notoriously hard to get, since their official API key service has been shut down. Finally, the Spotify portion should be fairly easy - the only problem being that playing songs on the device requires a Premium subscription! Overall, implementation of services will be rather excruciating, and may happen over the span of a month or more.
